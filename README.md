# CodeWars
Code wars contest task. 
I wasnt sure if i can use class variables, so decided to not use them, and call it a challange :). 

To run: 
1. open cmd
2. in cmd: 
	cd <.path to SoFixIt directory.>
3. in cmd with SoFixIt dir: 
	mvn package exec:java -Dexec.args="arg1 arg2 arg3"

(to run in that way maven is required)*
(also i've been using Inteliji terminal to run with args and it was fine)**

thats it :) u can see result in cmd

examples:
cd C:\Users\.<.USER.>\Desktop\SoFixIt\SoFixIt

C:\Users\<.USER.>\Desktop\SoFixIt\SoFixIt>mvn package exec:java -Dexec.args="1 0 1 0 1"

<.USER.> -> your username
